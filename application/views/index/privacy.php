                                <p>Our App uses "Cookies" to identify the areas of our App that you have visited. A Cookie is a small piece of data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to personalize the Content that you see on our App. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on our App correctly or at all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.</p>

LocName abides by this demand. LocName just collects information willingly offered; no information is gathered passively. children under 13 can submit only their email address when sending us an email in our &quot;Contact Us&quot; area. LocName makes use of the e-mail address to respond to a one-time demand from a child under 13 and afterwards deletes the e-mail address. In case LocName collects and maintains personal information relating to a child under 13, the parent may send out an email to us  to review, alter and/or erase such info as well as to decline to enable any additional collection or use of the child's information.</p>
